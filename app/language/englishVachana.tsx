    "When a hunter brings a rabbit \n they value it and buy it for coins.\n When the ruler of the land lies dead\n they wont value his corpse worth half a coin.\n Life of a man is worse than that of a rabbit.\n Have faith in our Koodalasangamadeva.",
  
    "If sharana sleeps, it is chanting.\nIf he gets up from sleep, it is Shivaraatri.\nWhat he does is pure act.\nWhat he speaks is Shiva-principle.\nThe very body of Koodalasanga’s sharana is kailaasa. ",
  
    "Shall I say scriptures are great?\nThey praise karma.\nShall I say the Vedas are great?\nThey tell of animal sacrifice.\nShall I say shruti is great?\nIt searches what is before one’s eyes.\nAs you are not in any of those, Koodalasangama, You can be seen in nothing but three kinds of daasoha. ",
  
    "Men without thought of Shiva,\nwithout knowledge of Shiva,\nare like millions of vermin in cow dung.\nDon’t the wild animals live together?\nDon’t the animals in town live together?\nAny place where there are no sharanas of Koodalasanga is worse than wilderness, a hilly forest of human creatures.",
  
    "Having born a Shiva devotee,\nbeing one with linga,\nhaving linga on the body,\nand if you praise others,\nappreciate words of others,\ncelebrate others,\nyou will fall into karma,\nyou cannot escape the chains of worldliness,\nyou cannot escape taking birth as a dog.\nThat’s why Koodalasangamadeva\nthe life of the faithless deceivers \nis like building a wall in sand and washing it in water.",
  
    "Being a devotee and you go to Shiva\nhoping he will hold you.\nHe will hit you, pound you to powder,\nwill make you dust, will turn you to ash.\nIf you have firm faith\nKoodalasangamadeva will ultimately\nmake you like him.",
  
    "Can you say Nambiyanna is a kid?\nCan you say sun is little?\nHe shines the whole world.\nCan you say sight is little?\nIt sees the whole creation.\nCan you say feeling is little?\nIt makes a measuring jar linga.\nKoodalasangamadevayya\nCan you say Channabasavanna,\nwho is beyond time and space, is little?",
  
    "What if he eats dog-meat?\nLinga devotee is highborn.\nIf one has no faith and doubts it is useless.\nWhat if you tie ishtalinga,\ntouch it and worship it,\nunless your mind is touched with devotion?\nUnless feelings are pure devotion will not be stable in one whom Koodalasangama doesn’t love.",
  
    "Like a dog not knowing how to put the pot back on shelf\nafter tumbling it down and eating the food in it,\nwhat shall I do studying six sthalas\nunless my bad qualities are done away?\nI am undone by not knowing how to do\ndaasoha to creator jangama-linga, Koodalasangamadeva.",

    "As actions spring from linga, as words spring from linga, why should lingavanta be afraid? He should be as linga wills, as respect or otherwise of devotees is responsibility of Koodalasangama.",
    "Where there is linga there will not be words of abuse. Where there is abuse, linga is not. What does it matter how they are, where they are, the lingavantas? A sharana of Koodalasanga is incomparable.",
    "Is linga not there in boundary marking stone? Is linga not there in the marks on thighs of cattle? If stone is placed on a bush and that stone is found can the bush become a devotee? That’s why only a person with truthfulness, naturalness, good feelings and action is a true devotee. Otherwise he is like the stone found on a bush, Koodalasangamadeva.",
    "To walk without linga, to speak without linga to swallow saliva without linga is pollution that very moment. The body of those who walk without linga is worldly, not to be touched. The body of those who speak without linga is polluted with death, not to be heard. If one moves without linga each step he takes, each word he utters makes him lose his vow Koodalasangamadeva.",
    "Looking at good things, if mind desires them however much it is of no use. Stretching hands, looking up at the fruit in the tall palm tree it is mere ache in the neck. Listen Koodalasangamadeva, we have only when you give.",
    "What if you earn good name and live five days? What if you earn good name and live four days? What if you earn good name and live three days? What if you earn good name and live two days? As it is saidjeevitam shivabhaktaanam varam panchadinaani ca naajakalpasahasraani bhakriheenasya shaankari. What if you live for a single day earning good name in the vachanas of sharanas, Koodalasangamadeva!",
    "Why attempt to straighten the crookedness of the world? Console your body, console your mind. Koodalasangamadeva will not appreciate those who weep for the sake of neighbors.",
    "Speech filled with nectar of your name eyes filled with your image mind filled with your thought ears filled with your fame Koodalasangamadeva At your lotus feet I will be like a bee full-filled.",
    "If wild cuckoo is brought home does it forget remembering its forest? If elephant from hills is brought home does it forget remembering its hill? If sharanas of Koodalasangamadeva come to this earth Do they forget thinking of primordial and infinite linga?",
    "T don’t know weeks or days. I don’t know. I don’t know if it is night or day, I don’t know. Worshiping you I forgot myself, Koodalasangamadeva.",

    "You call yourself brave devotee with restraint. If you are brave, enemies should praise you. If you have restraint, women should praise you. If you are a devotee, jangama should praise you. If you act according to your words Koodalasangamadeva will give you what you ask.",
    "I shall put leather sheath to the Vedas I shall put shackles on the shastras I shall skin the back of Tarka I shall cut off the nose of Agamas. See lord most generous Koodalasangamadeva I am vassal of Maadara Chennayyas house.",
    "The Vedas shivered, scriptures stood aside, logic became dumb, aagama just went away, all because our Koodalasangayya had his food in the house of untouchable Maadara Chennayya.",
    "Like a fish-eating bird sitting on the banks they hold their noses in meditation. They let their hair grow tangled, move their lips, close their eyes and count on their fingers the number of chants. Grass held in their hands as if they yearn for protection, Koodalasangamadeva.",
    "Getting up at the break of dawn, touching the feet of linga, and looking at the face of Shiva sharana at the break of day- this is the way to make ones birth fruitful. These words are true. Koodalasangamadeva doesnt want them who are not like this.",
    "Like lightning hidden behind clouds, like soul hidden behind the the body, like treasure hidden under the earth, god, you are. Who can ever know you? Knowing this for long and yet forgetting and ignoring I have gone mad. My mistakes have no end, Koodalasangamadeva, save me, save me.",
    "Doing exercise for three hundred and sixty days and forgetting all the skills of the hand in the battle ground- my bhakti is like that. When the mind is not firm what use, what use, how long I worship linga? Breaking the pot of milk, is it possible for me to gather spilt milk, Koodalasangamadeva?",
    "Does Mount Meru seek for great qualities in a crow? Does touchstone seek for qualities in iron? Does the virtuous seek for goodness in a wicked person? Does the sandal-wood seek for qualities in all trees? o linga filled with all qualities why do you seek for negative qualities in me Koodalasangamadeva?",

    "What can a sword do if it’s sharp edge is no more? What will a snake do if its poison is no more? What will a knowing devotee do if his words go false? When the words go false and desire to live it is like dog eating food reserved for god, Koodalasangamadeva.",
    "Offering sheep to tiny troublesome gods carried on winnowing fan they dance in joy. Does sheep die and protect those with whom Shiva is angry? No sheep, no calf, just worship our Koodalasangamadeva with leaves, it is enough.",
    "Eating in silence is not righteousness. After offering food to god one should say Shiva’ for every morsel. Then if you eat thinking of Koodalasanga the ways of flesh are made quiet.",
    "My mind is for nothing but linga, my wealth is for nothing but jangama, my body is for nothing but prasaada. It is my oath that I will not open my mouth but for linga jangama prasaada. If not offered thus, mistake is mine, cut my nose Koodalasangamadeva.",
    "Having faith that linga and jangama are one one should know wives of jangamas are wives of linga. Mating with this woman and that does one mate with Chowdeshwari too? If you embrace woman of jangama without the feeling that you are her baby Koodalasangamadeva will cut your head off.",
    "Is there harshness in linga? Is there caste for jangama? Is there tastelessness in prasaada? I will not differentiate my feelings in these three Koodalasangamadeva, my devotion is like steady stream of holy water from the vessel.",
    "Once you worship linga you should fear and respect jangama. Do not be stiff as if you have swallowed an iron rod. If you bow like a bunch of ripe banana Koodalasangama will give you what you ask.",

    "Give me the joy of looking at the face of jangama as I worship linga. Give me this ultimate bliss linga. This is the boon I beg you Koodalasangamadeva.",
    "Being in the shadow of a tree can one search ones’ shadow? What kind of devotee am I? What kind of worthy am I in the presence of your sharanas? Won’t the words I am a devotee burn me Koodalasangamadeva?",
    "Like a monkey that has climbed the tree I dash from branch to branch. How can I have faith? How can I have love for this burnt mind? It doesn’t allow me to move towards my father Koodalasangamadeva.",
    "Plucking flower from the tree and offering it to the tree, offering river water to the river, o, do not take away the calf from the cow making the cow suffer don’t milk it for your use. The Maya created by Koodalasanga has beaten many.",
    "Fire born out of friction of trees, will it not burn those trees? Fire of knowledge, born out of companionship of the wise, will it not burn away the nature of my senses? That’s why Koodalasangamadeva, show me the wise.",
    "This world is maker’s mint. Those who are acceptable here are acceptable there too. Those who have no currency here are not accepted there too, Koodalasangamadeva.",
    "However much you rub can black soot become white? Effects of Karma do not go away. What if one receives endless honors? A moment of sloth undoes everything, Koodalasangamadeva I am a pretender I believe and yet do not have faith in you.",
    "If you feel you have done terrible sound of Shiva’s drum will haunt you. Do not say you have done something for linga, you have done something for jangama. If your mind doesn’t retain the trace of your acts Koodalasangamadeva will grant you all your whishes.",
    "By doing and giving, all those who say you worship linga, listen brothers- Like leaving footwear at the doors of the temple and remembering them as you bow before god you meditate upon footwear and not on god.

    "The good devotees don’t relish the daasoha of the one without devotion. A crow relishes bitter fruit of neem, but a cuckoo cannot. Sharanas of Koodalasangamadeva don’t relish the words of those unrelated to linga.",
    "If you can be a bhakta in various births, see, it is better to have those births. Worship of linga, experience of jangama are each day’s bliss. I wish for them for ever, O father, Koodalasangamadeva, grant me this.",
    "Can you paint without a canvass? Can you grow without the earth? Can you worship linga without jangama? Can you penetrate the lord of life without a body? As Koodalasangamadeva the un-manifest has the face of jangama I don’t know anything else.",

    "For the Bherunda bird having one body and two heads, if you put blinkers between two heads and pour milk for one mouth and poison for another will not poison spread in one body? Worshiping linga and blaming jangama, I fume in rage Koodalasangamadeva.",
    "Tonsuring my head I became a male slave. I may be immodest, but I will please linga. I may be unashamed, but I will please linga, Let the worldly neighbors laugh, if they feel like it, Koodalasangamadeva I submit myself to you.",

    "To make a pot earth comes first. To make ornaments gold comes first. To know the path of Shiva path of guru comes first. To know Koodalasangamadeva company of sharanas comes first.",
    "Pot made of earth cannot become earth losing its form. Butter melting and becoming ghee cannot become butter again losing its form. Gold cannot become iron losing its form. Pearl born in water cannot become water again losing its form. Once a sharana of Koodalasanga cannot become a mere man losing his form.",
    "The mind a snake the body a basket. Living in company with the snake, when it will kill me, I do not know when it will swallow me, I do not know. If I can worship you each day that is the charm against the snake Koodalasangamadeva.",
    "Look at the house, they are poor. Look at the mind, they are rich. Remaining pure regarding women, they are brave in every sense. Nothing in store, but have enough when they need. The sharanas of Koodalasanga are independent and brave.",
    "Is the master of the house in, or is he not? Grass growing around the threshold, the house filled with dust, is the master of the house in, or is he not? The body filled with lies, the mind filled with desires, the master of the mind, is he in or he is not? The master of the mind is not in the mind, Koodalasangamadeva.",
    "Considering the root to be the mouth of the tree if you pour water at the bottom, see the tree sprouted at the top.
